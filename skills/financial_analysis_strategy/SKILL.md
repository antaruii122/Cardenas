## The 4 Pillars of Financial Analysis (Benefits)

### 1. Evaluación de Rentabilidad (Profitability Evaluation)
*Concept*: Move beyond "selling" to "earning".
*Key Point*: It's not about how much you sell, but how much you keep. Identifying net margins reveals if the business model is truly viable.

### 2. Toma de Decisiones Estratégicas (Strategic Decision Making)
*Concept*: Data-driven navigation.
*Key Point*: Stop guessing. Use data to decide whether to hire, invest in marketing, or cut costs. Financial analysis turns intuition into science.

### 3. Detección de Riesgos y Oportunidades (Risk & Opportunity Detection)
*Concept*: Early warning system.
*Key Point*: Spot trends before they become problems (e.g., rising cost of goods). Identify high-margin products to double down on.

### 4. Acceso a Financiamiento (Access to Financing)
*Concept*: Trust and credibility.
*Key Point*: Banks and investors don't trust enthusiasm; they trust numbers. A clear financial report is your passport to capital for growth.
